# Hello

## You can clone this project, install dependencies, and run yarn start.

### This is an MVP version, there is still a lot todo.
### No redux here
### There is still a lot to do:
    1. Replace local state in Main component with useReducer
    2. Finish all tests
    3. Optimize with useCallback / React.memo / useMemo
    4. This one is not adaptive, so please use it on full screen
    5. Handle different errors and gently show them to user

### Please make contact on LinkedIn if any questions.
